    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age1 = age;
    // console.log(age, age1);
    // age1 = 200;
    // console.log(age, age1);

    // let str = 'Jeff';
    // let str1 = str;
    // console.log(str, str1);
    // str1 = 'Tony';
    // console.log(str, str1);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;
    // team is just reference of players
    // console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // team[3] = 'Jeff';
    // console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];

    // Array.from()

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const person = {
        name: 'Jeff Liu',
        age: 23
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const students = person;
    //students.age = 90;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const students1 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 45, age: 55});
    console.log(students1);
    students1.age = 28;

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // const students2 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const personData = {
        name: 'Jeff',
        age: 23,
        constact: {
            FB: 'jeff6304520',
            mail: 'jeff@gamil.com'
        }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(personData);

    const notACopy = Object.assign({}, personData);

    // go search deep clone
    // A cheating way

    const copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(personData));
